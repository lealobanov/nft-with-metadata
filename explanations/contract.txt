This is a NFT resource that abides by the NFT standard and the Metadata standard. It imports both interfaces into the resource.

From there, metadata such as id, name, thumbnail, description, power, will, and determination are defined and initialized. The functions to resolveView and getViews are also included to make viewing the metadata easy.
